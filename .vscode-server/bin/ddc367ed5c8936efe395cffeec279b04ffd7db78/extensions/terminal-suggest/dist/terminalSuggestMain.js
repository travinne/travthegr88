However, if no arguments are given, the positional parameters remain those of the calling context, and no restoring is done.\n\n    If *file* was not found the return status is 127; if *file* was found but contained a syntax error the return status is 126; else the return status is the exit status of the last command executed.",args:". file [ arg ... ]"},":":{shortDescription:"No effect",description:":   This command does nothing, although normal argument expansions is performed which may have effects on shell parameters.

A trailing space in *value* causes the next word to be checked for alias expansion. If the **-g** flag is present, define a global alias; global aliases are expanded even if they do not occur in command position:\n\n    > % perldoc --help 2>&1 | grep 'built-in functions'\n    >         -f   Search Perl built-in functions\n    >     % alias -g HG='--help 2>&1 | grep'\n    >     % perldoc HG 'built-in functions'\n    >         -f   Search Perl built-in functions\n\n    If the **-s** flag is present, define a suffix alias: if the command word on a command line is in the form `*text***.***name*`, where *text* is any non-empty string, it is replaced by the text `*value* *text***.***name*`. Note that *name* is treated as a literal string, not a pattern. A trailing space in *value* is not special in this case. For example,\n\n    > alias -s ps='gv --'\n\n    will cause the command `**\\*.ps**` to be expanded to `**gv \\-- \\*.ps**`. As alias expansion is carried out earlier than globbing, the `**\\*.ps**` will then be expanded. Suffix aliases constitute a different name space from other aliases (so in the above example it is still possible to create an alias for the command **ps**) and the two sets are never listed together.\n\n    For each *name* with no *value*, print the value of *name*, if any. With no arguments, print all currently defined aliases other than suffix aliases. If the **-m** flag is given the arguments are taken as patterns (they should be quoted to preserve them from being interpreted as glob patterns), and the aliases matching these patterns are printed. When printing aliases and one of the **-g**, **-r** or **-s** flags is present, restrict the printing to global, regular or suffix aliases, respectively; a regular alias is one which is neither a global nor a suffix alias. Using `**+**` instead of `**-**`, or ending the option list with a single `**+**`, prevents the values of the aliases from being printed.\n\n    If the **-L** flag is present, then print each alias in a manner suitable for putting in a startup script. The exit status is nonzero if a *name* (with no *value*) is given for which no alias has been defined.\n\n    For more on aliases, include common problems, see the section ALIASING in *zshmisc*(1).",args:"alias [ {+|-}gmrsL ] [ name[=value] ... ]"},autoload:{shortDescription:"Autoload a function",description:":   See the section `Autoloading Functions` in *zshmisc*(1) for full details. The **fpath** parameter will be searched to find the function definition when the function is first referenced.\n\n    If *name* consists of an absolute path, the function is defined to load from the file given (searching as usual for dump files in the given location). The name of the function is the basename (non-directory part) of the file. It is normally an error if the function is not found in the given location; however, if the option **-d** is given, searching for the function defaults to **\\$fpath**. If a function is loaded by absolute path, any functions loaded from it that are marked for **autoload** without an absolute path have the load path of the parent function temporarily prepended to **\\$fpath**.\n\n    If the option **-r** or **-R** is given, the function is searched for immediately and the location is recorded internally for use when the function is executed; a relative path is expanded using the value of **\\$PWD**. This protects against a change to **\\$fpath** after the call to **autoload**. With **-r**, if the function is not found, it is silently left unresolved until execution; with **-R**, an error message is printed and command processing aborted immediately the search fails, i.e. at the **autoload** command rather than at function execution..\n\n    The flag **-X** may be used only inside a shell function. It causes the calling function to be marked for autoloading and then immediately loaded and executed, with the current array of positional parameters as arguments. This replaces the previous definition of the function. If no function definition is found, an error is printed and the function remains undefined and marked for autoloading. If an argument is given, it is used as a directory (i.e. it does not include the name of the function) in which the function is to be found; this may be combined with the **-d** option to allow the function search to default to **\\$fpath** if it is not in the given location.\n\n    The flag **+X** attempts to load each *name* as an autoloaded function, but does *not* execute it. The exit status is zero (success) if the function was not previously defined *and* a definition for it was found. This does *not* replace any existing definition of the function. The exit status is nonzero (failure) if the function was already defined or when no definition was found. In the latter case the function remains undefined and marked for autoloading. If ksh-style autoloading is enabled, the function created will contain the contents of the file plus a call to the function itself appended to it, thus giving normal ksh autoloading behaviour on the first call to the function. If the **-m** flag is also given each *name* is treated as a pattern and all functions already marked for autoload that match the pattern are loaded.\n\n    With the **-t** flag, turn on execution tracing; with **-T**, turn on execution tracing only for the current function, turning it off on entry to any called functions that do not also have tracing enabled.\n\n    With the **-U** flag, alias expansion is suppressed when the function is loaded.\n\n    With the **-w** flag, the *name*s are taken as names of files compiled with the **zcompile** builtin, and all functions defined in them are marked for autoloading.\n\n    The flags **-z** and **-k** mark the function to be autoloaded using the zsh or ksh style, as if the option **KSH_AUTOLOAD** were unset or were set, respectively. The flags override the setting of the option at the time the function is loaded.\n\n    Note that the **autoload** command makes no attempt to ensure the shell options set during the loading or execution of the file have any particular value. For this, the **emulate** command can be used:\n\n    > emulate zsh -c 'autoload -Uz func'\n\n    arranges that when *func is loaded the shell is in native* **zsh** emulation, and this emulation is also applied when *func is run.*\n\n    Some of the functions of **autoload** *are also provided by* **functions** -u *or* **functions -U***, but* **autoload** *is a more comprehensive* interface.",args:"autoload [ {+|-}RTUXdkmrtWz ] [ -w ] [ name ... ]"},bg:{shortDescription:"Put a job in the background",description:"*job \\...* **&** Put each specified *job in the background,* or the current job if none is specified.",args:"bg [ job ... ]"},bindkey:{shortDescription:"Manipulate keymap names",description:":   See the section `Zle Builtins` in *zshzle(1).*",args:"bindkey"},break:{shortDescription:"Exit from a loop",description:":   Exit from an enclosing **for***,* **while***,* **until***,* **select** *or* **repeat** *loop.

If the **-L** *switch is given,* the options **LOCAL_OPTIONS***,* **LOCAL_PATTERNS** *and* **LOCAL_TRAPS** will be set as well, causing the effects of the **emulate** *command and any* **setopt***,* **disable -p** *or* **enable -p***, and* **trap** *commands to be local to* the immediately surrounding shell function, if any; normally these options are turned off in all emulation modes except **ksh***. The* **-L** *switch is mutually exclusive with the* use of **-c** *in flags.*\n\n    If there is a single argument and the **-l** *switch is given, the* options that would be set or unset (the latter indicated with the prefix `**no***`) are listed.* **-l** *can be combined with* **-L** *or* **-R** *and* the list will be modified in the appropriate way. Note the list does not depend on the current setting of options, i.e. it includes all options that may in principle change, not just those that would actually change.\n\n    The *flags may be any of the invocation-time flags described in* the section INVOCATION in *zsh(1),* except that `**-o EMACS***` and `***-o VI***` may not be used. Flags such* as `**+r***`/`***+o RESTRICTED***` may be prohibited in some circumstances.*\n\n    If **-c** *arg appears in flags, arg is evaluated while the* requested emulation is temporarily in effect. In this case the emulation mode and all options are restored to their previous values before **emulate** *returns. The* **-R** *switch may precede the name of the shell* to emulate; note this has a meaning distinct from including **-R** *in* *flags.*\n\n    Use of **-c** *enables `sticky` emulation mode for functions defined* within the evaluated expression: the emulation mode is associated thereafter with the function so that whenever the function is executed the emulation (respecting the **-R** *switch, if present) and all* options are set (and pattern disables cleared) before entry to the function, and the state is restored after exit. If the function is called when the sticky emulation is already in effect, either within an `**emulate** *shell* **-c***` expression or* within another function with the same sticky emulation, entry and exit from the function do not cause options to be altered (except due to standard processing such as the **LOCAL_OPTIONS** *option). This also* applies to functions marked for autoload within the sticky emulation; the appropriate set of options will be applied at the point the function is loaded as well as when it is run.\n\n    For example:\n\n    > emulate sh -c 'fni() { setopt cshnullglob; }\n    >     fno() { fni; }'\n    >     fno\n\n    The two functions **fni** *and* **fno** *are defined with sticky* **sh** emulation. **fno** *is then executed, causing options associated* with emulations to be set to their values in **sh***.* **fno** *then* calls **fni***; because* **fni** *is also marked for sticky* **sh** emulation, no option changes take place on entry to or exit from it. Hence the option **cshnullglob***, turned off by* **sh** *emulation, will* be turned on within **fni** *and remain on return to* **fno***. On exit* from **fno***, the emulation mode and all options will be restored to the* state they were in before entry to the temporary emulation.\n\n    The documentation above is typically sufficient for the intended purpose of executing code designed for other shells in a suitable environment. More detailed rules follow.\n\n    1\\.\n\n    :   The sticky emulation environment provided by `**emulate** *shell* **-c***` is identical to that provided by entry to* a function marked for sticky emulation as a consequence of being defined in such an environment.

This example creates a scalar **svar** containing the value **two** *and another scalar parameter* **words** *with* no value. An array value in this case would either cause an error or be treated as an obscure set of glob qualifiers.\n>\n> Arbitrary arguments are allowed if they take the form of assignments after command line expansion; however, these only perform scalar assignment:\n>\n> > var=\'svar=val\'\n> >     typeset $var\n>\n> The above sets the scalar parameter **svar** *to the value* **val***.* Parentheses around the value within **var** *would not cause array* assignment as they will be treated as ordinary characters when **\\$var** is substituted. Any non-trivial expansion in the name part of the assignment causes the argument to be treated in this fashion:\n>\n> > typeset {var1,var2,var3}=name\n>\n> The above syntax is valid, and has the expected effect of setting the three parameters to the same value, but the command line is parsed as a set of three normal command line arguments to **typeset** *after* expansion. Hence it is not possible to assign to multiple arrays by this means.\n>\n> Note that each interface to any of the commands may be disabled separately. For example, `**disable -r typeset***` disables the reserved* word interface to **typeset***, exposing the builtin interface, while* `**disable typeset***` disables the builtin. Note that disabling the* reserved word interface for **typeset** *may cause problems with the* output of `**typeset -p***`, which assumes the reserved word interface is* available in order to restore array and associative array values.\n>\n> Unlike parameter assignment statements, **typeset***\\\'s exit status on an* assignment that involves a command substitution does not reflect the exit status of the command substitution. Therefore, to test for an error in a command substitution, separate the declaration of the parameter from its initialization:\n>\n> > # WRONG\n> >     typeset var1=$(exit 1) || echo "Trouble with var1"\n> >\n> >     # RIGHT\n> >     typeset var1 && var1=$(exit 1) || echo "Trouble with var1"\n>\n> To initialize a parameter *param to a command output and mark it readonly,* use **typeset -r** *param or* **readonly** *param after the parameter* assignment statement.\n>\n> If no attribute flags are given, and either no *name arguments are* present or the flag **+m** *is used, then each parameter name printed is* preceded by a list of the attributes of that parameter (**array***,* **association***,* **exported***,* **float***,* **integer***,* **readonly***,* or **undefined** *for autoloaded parameters not yet loaded).

No *name arguments may appear,* and it is an error for any other options to follow `**+***`. The* effect of `**+***` is as if all attribute flags which precede it were* given with a `**+***` prefix. For example, `***typeset -U +***` is* equivalent to `**typeset +U***` and displays the names of all arrays having* the uniqueness attribute, whereas `**typeset -f -U +***` displays the* names of all autoloadable functions. If **+** *is the only option,* then type information (array, readonly, etc.) is also printed for each parameter, in the same manner as `**typeset +m \\"\\*\\"***`.*\n>\n> **-g**\n>\n> :   The **-g** *(global) means that any resulting parameter will not be* restricted to local scope. Note that this does not necessarily mean that the parameter will be global, as the flag will apply to any existing parameter (even if unset) from an enclosing function.

With no arguments, the list of parameters created in this fashion is shown. With two or three arguments, the first two are the name of a scalar and of an array parameter (in that order) that will be tied together in the manner of **\\$PATH** *and* **\\$path***. The optional third* argument is a single-character separator which will be used to join the elements of the array to form the scalar; if absent, a colon is used, as with **\\$PATH***. Only the first character of the separator is significant;* any remaining characters are ignored. Multibyte characters are not yet supported.\n>\n>     Only one of the scalar and array parameters may be assigned an initial value (the restrictions on assignment forms described above also apply).\n>\n>     Both the scalar and the array may be manipulated as normal.

This may also be set for tied parameters (see **-T***) or colon-separated special parameters like* **PATH** *or* **FIGNORE***, etc. Note the flag takes effect on assignment,* and the type of the variable being assigned to is determinative; for variables with shared values it is therefore recommended to set the flag for all interfaces, e.g. `**typeset -U PATH path***`.*\n>\n>     This flag has a different meaning when used with **-f***; see below.*\n>\n> **-Z** *\\[ n \\]*\n>\n> :   Specially handled if set along with the **-L** *flag.* Otherwise, similar to **-R***, except that leading zeros are used for* padding instead of blanks if the first non-blank character is a digit. Numeric parameters are specially handled: they are always eligible for padding with zeroes, and the zeroes are inserted at an appropriate place in the output.\n>\n> **-a**\n>\n> :   The names refer to array parameters.

The flag* **-t** *turns on execution tracing* for this function; the flag **-T** *does the same, but turns off tracing* for any named (not anonymous) function called from the present one, unless that function also has the **-t** *or* **-T** *flag. The* **-u** *and* **-U** *flags cause the* function to be marked for autoloading; **-U** *also causes alias* expansion to be suppressed when the function is loaded. See the description of the `**autoload***` builtin for details.*\n>\n>     Note that the builtin **functions** *provides the same basic capabilities* as **typeset -f** *but gives access to a few extra options;* **autoload** gives further additional options for the case **typeset -fu** *and* **typeset -fU***.*\n>\n> **-h**\n>\n> :   Hide: only useful for special parameters (those marked `\\<S\\>` in the table in *zshparam(1)), and for local parameters with the same name as a special parameter,* though harmless for others. A special parameter with this attribute will not retain its special effect when made local. Thus after `**typeset -h** PATH*`, a function containing `***typeset PATH***` will create an ordinary* local parameter without the usual behaviour of **PATH***. Alternatively,* the local parameter may itself be given this attribute; hence inside a function `**typeset -h PATH***` creates an ordinary local parameter and the* special **PATH** *parameter is not altered in any way. It is also possible* to create a local parameter using `**typeset +h** *special`, where the* local copy of *special will retain its special properties regardless of* having the **-h** *attribute. Global special parameters loaded from shell* modules (currently those in **zsh/mapfile** *and* **zsh/parameter***) are* automatically given the **-h** *attribute to avoid name clashes.*\n>\n> **-H**\n>\n> :   Hide value: specifies that **typeset** *will not display the value of the* parameter when listing parameters; the display for such parameters is always as if the `**+***` flag had been given.

In such cases the output of `**zcompile -c***` does not include the additional functions defined in* the file, and any other initialization code in the file is lost.

This is done in such a way that multiple instances of the shell running on the same host will share this mapped file.

The **-L** *option changes this format to a list of* **zmodload -a** commands.\n> >\n> > If **-b** *is used together with the* **-u** *option, it removes builtins* previously defined with **-ab***. This is only possible if the builtin is* not yet loaded. **-i** *suppresses the error if the builtin is already* removed (or never existed).\n> >\n> > Autoload requests are retained if the module is subsequently unloaded until an explicit `**zmodload -ub** *builtin` is issued.*\n>\n> **zmodload** **-ac** *\\[* **-IL** *\\]*\n>\n> **zmodload** **-ac** *\\[* **-iI** *\\] name \\[ cond \\... \\]*\n>\n> **zmodload** **-uc** *\\[* **-iI** *\\] cond \\...* The **-ac** *option is used to define autoloaded condition codes. The* *cond strings give the names of the conditions defined by the* module. The optional **-I** *option is used to define infix condition* names. Without this option prefix condition names are defined.\n>\n> > If given no condition names, all defined names are listed (as a series of **zmodload** *commands if the* **-L** *option is given).*\n> >\n> > The **-uc** *option removes definitions for autoloaded conditions.*\n>\n> **zmodload** **-ap** *\\[* **-L** *\\]*\n>\n> **zmodload** **-ap** *\\[* **-i** *\\] name \\[ parameter \\... \\]*\n>\n> **zmodload** **-up** *\\[* **-i** *\\] parameter \\...* The **-p** *option is like the* **-b** *and* **-c** *options, but makes* **zmodload** *work on autoloaded parameters instead.*\n>\n> **zmodload** **-af** *\\[* **-L** *\\]*\n>\n> **zmodload** **-af** *\\[* **-i** *\\] name \\[ function \\... \\]*\n>\n> **zmodload** **-uf** *\\[* **-i** *\\] function \\...* The **-f** *option is like the* **-b***,* **-p***, and* **-c** *options, but* makes **zmodload** *work on autoloaded math functions instead.*\n>\n> **zmodload** **-a** *\\[* **-L** *\\]*\n>\n> **zmodload** **-a** *\\[* **-i** *\\] name \\[ builtin \\... \\]*\n>\n> **zmodload** **-ua** *\\[* **-i** *\\] builtin \\...* Equivalent to **-ab** *and* **-ub***.*\n>\n> **zmodload -e** *\\[* **-A** *\\] \\[ string \\... \\]*\n>\n> :   The **-e** *option without arguments lists all loaded modules; if the* **-A** option is also given, module aliases corresponding to loaded modules are also shown. If arguments are provided, nothing is printed; the return status is set to zero if all *strings given as arguments* are names of loaded modules and to one if at least on *string is not* the name of a loaded module. This can be used to test for the availability of things implemented by modules. In this case, any aliases are automatically resolved and the **-A** *flag is not used.*\n>\n> **zmodload**  **-A** *\\[* **-L** *\\] \\[ modalias\\[***=***module\\] \\... \\]*\n>\n> :   For each argument, if both *modalias and module are given,* define *modalias to be an alias for the module module.* If the module *modalias is ever subsequently requested, either via a* call to **zmodload** *or implicitly, the shell will attempt to load* *module instead. If module is not given, show the definition of* *modalias. If no arguments are given, list all defined module aliases.* When listing, if the **-L** *flag was also given, list the definition as a* **zmodload** *command to recreate the alias.*\n>\n>     The existence of aliases for modules is completely independent of whether the name resolved is actually loaded as a module: while the alias exists, loading and unloading the module under any alias has exactly the same effect as using the resolved name, and does not affect the connection between the alias and the resolved name which can be removed either by **zmodload -R** *or by redefining the alias. Chains of aliases (i.e. where* the first resolved name is itself an alias) are valid so long as these are not circular. As the aliases take the same format as module names, they may include path separators: in this case, there is no requirement for any part of the path named to exist as the alias will be resolved first. For example, `**any/old/alias***` is always a valid alias.*\n>\n>     Dependencies added to aliased modules are actually added to the resolved module; these remain if the alias is removed. It is valid to create an alias whose name is one of the standard shell modules and which resolves to a different module. However, if a module has dependencies, it will not be possible to use the module name as an alias as the module will already be marked as a loadable module in its own right.\n>\n>     Apart from the above, aliases can be used in the **zmodload** *command* anywhere module names are required. However, aliases will not be shown in lists of loaded modules with a bare `**zmodload***`.*\n>\n> **zmodload**  **-R** *modalias \\...* \n>\n> :   For each *modalias argument that was previously defined as a module* alias via **zmodload -A***, delete the alias. If any was not defined, an* error is caused and the remainder of the line is ignored.\n>\n> Note that **zsh** *makes no distinction between modules that were linked* into the shell and modules that are loaded dynamically. In both cases this builtin command has to be used to make available the builtins and other things defined by modules (unless the module is autoloaded on these definitions).
